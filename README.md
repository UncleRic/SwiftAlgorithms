# SwiftAlgorithms
This applications demos assorted algorithms.  First phase is the Fibonacci Series using Dynamic Programming.

The Fibonacci Series is a popular algorithm; with one purpose being demoing the importance of 'Dyanamic Programming'.
Dynamic programming is when you use past knowledge to make solving a future problem easier.  Dynamic programming is used a lot in string problems, such as the string edit problem.

This is important for reducing intensive processing that's needed to produce the Fibonacci Series by relying of past processing results.

This project is currently at phase #1.
Later phases shall include additional popular algorithms.
